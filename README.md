# Word-Embedding-Visualization
To get the feel of what word embeddings are, you can use t-SNE [2] to visualize these high di-
mensional vectors in a 2-dimensional space. We already provide the implementation in the le
visual_word_embed.py. By running it, you can nd how the words are distributed. In this ques-
tion, you are asked to pick up some subset of the whole vocabulary and explain what you have
found inside the visualization
